## How It Works

1. **Real-Time Canvas**: Use your webcam to draw or write in the air. Our technology captures your creations in real-time.

2. **Image to Text**: Your air-drawn masterpieces are converted into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

3. **Text-to-Speech**: Experience your creations coming to life as the converted text is read aloud with text-to-speech technology.

4. **Screenshot**: Your artwork is saved as "screenshot.png" in the "screenshot" folder, allowing you to revisit and share your creations.
